; Description: This program gets two integers from the user,
;	and calculates the summation of the integers from the
;	first to the second.  For example, if the user enters
;	1 and 10, the program calculates 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10.

;	Note: This program does not perform any data validation.
;   If the user gives invalid input, the output will be
;   meaningless.

;  Implementation notes:
;	This program is implemented using procedures.
;	All variables are global ... no parameter passing
